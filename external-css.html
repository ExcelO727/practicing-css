    <h2>PC Hardware</h2>
    <p>
      My favourite part of PC Hardware is probably when we have kahoots and when
      we get to talk about different components of a pc. My least favourite part
      of PC Hardware is when we have to sit through the presentations. Although
      they have good information, it is quite boring.

    <h2>Web Development</h2>
    <p>
      My favourite part of Web Development is when we get the chance to test out
      new code that we have learnt, and get a chance to play with it and try out
      new things. My least favourite part, like PC Hardware is when we have to
      sit through the presentations.
